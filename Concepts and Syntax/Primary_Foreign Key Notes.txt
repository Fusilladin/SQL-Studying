Primary/Foreign Key Notes

flat file  - simple
relational database - complicated

break about the flat file into 2 tables
    removes data redundancy

Primary key: field that uniquely identifies every field in one table
Foreign key: doesn't uniquely identify every order, but it relates back to the other table.

relationship can be:
    1 to 1 [1-1]
    1 to many [1-m]
    many to many [m-m]

each customer can have MANY orders but each customer has only ONE customer id, so 1-m

non-relational databases are more complex and require some other things outside of SQL

compact, well structured and efficient
using relational databases lowers the amount of loading time because u dont have to load every field of millions of records

database designer: plot the entire database system on a canvas using a vis tool
    1. Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:
        -[]-[]+[]
    2. Relational schema: an existing idea of how the database must be organized
    | customer_id |        | item_code   |
    | first_name  | -----> | customer_id |
    | last_name   |        | date        |
    ---------------        ---------------

Database creation:
    Use SQL to set up the database physically
Data manipulation:
    Allows you to use your dataset to extract biz intelligence
Database Management:
    comprises all of these previous steps

Database Administration:
    daily care and maintenance of database

Relational Schema:

-----------
-----

Primary Key: a column or set of columns whose value exists and is unique for every record in a tab
    - can only have 1 primary key
    - may be composed of a set of columns, and not just one single column (id_num, date)
    - cannot leave it blank/null
    - not all tables have a primary key

Foreign Key:
    - same as the primary key it is relating back to
    - cannot have a value that is not a value in the other table as the primary KEY
    - can have a value of blank/null
    - identify relationships between tables
